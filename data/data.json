Aunty you always made sure we were proper, kept nice short hair do‚Äô s and no makeup.You told us to focus on our studies.You said all that‚Äú nianga‚Äù translation‚Äú makeup‚Äù was a distraction to attract boys. I remember one fine summer holiday around age 14 yrs.I was all dressed up makeup and all ready to sneak out to meet with friends.‚ÄúYes sneak out‚Äù.Back in the days you sometimes had to do just that because, permission was not always granted.Mind you this was in bright day light if you know what I mean. Aunty you saw me about to sneak out; oops‚Äú busted!‚Äù.I remembered you called out‚Äú Moneh‚Äù.A nickname you seldom use only in times that signifies trouble! You asked where I thought I was going and one look at me with makeup on you told me I was going nowhere. Lessons learnt, I never asked for permission which I recognized was wrong.And on top of that You made me clean up my makeup.Can you imagine bubbles busted, heart racing knowing I was not going to hang out with friends..imagine the feelings. Moral to the story, despite my uncharacteristic truancy aunty that spirit in you of understanding and guidance you allowed me to still meetup with my friends.You highlighted what I did wrong, and made me apologize for my poor choice action. You could have grounded me but you did not.You knew I would be heartbroken after a well planned rendezvous with friends.Your approach to problem solving taught me a better lesson on how to approach similar situations the future. Aunty, till this day, I emulate that practice with my kids Ambe and Azinwi; that spirit of understanding, guidance and tough loveüíï Love you forever Auntyüíï Continue to rest well.",

If you had not called her for years, gave her nothing , or recognize and appreciate anything about her, she would not carry anger, vex, hatred or any sort of defiance against you. When she hears your long lost voice she brings you joy, take away your own guilt of abandonment. There‚Äôs been many times life took me away from her not being in touch regularly and when I did call she will scream with joy ‚Äúmadam irene ambe bi Nguni‚Äù addressing all known names. She inquired about the children, my husband and everyone. As we live this life we are not perfect but one thing for sure is our personal relationship with man and God which I know If I were to grade her I will give her A+ pass. I pray everyday honestly to emulate this woman for the kind of heart she has - bearing no grievances, forgiving, and accepting people as they are and make the best out of them. Aunty I have learnt, took things for granted but promised to be a better person.",

You meant so much to so many... and exemplified many of God's virtues - humility, kindness, love, generosity, brilliance and a fervent devotion to the Gospel.  Many a night, you spent in deep communion with Thee and many a day, you lived in intimate remembrance of Thee. Your mission in this fleeting world is over and you earned your rest and evolution to the next life. May your gentle soul continue to progress in God's Eternal Kingdom.

It dawned to me that all this years I or we lived with Dorcas. Auntie Therry was our Dorcas, who gave it all to everyone who came across her. He generosity new no limits. Our Dorcas is gone, it is time for us to come out to bear testimony of her goodness. Let the people know that Dorcas (Auntie therry) was our Mother, auntie, grand mother, sister, etc. Like the community of Lydda testified of the good works and acts of charity to the apostles, let the world know that you did encounter Dorcas in your life.Let the praises of her good deeds from your mouths go with her.Auntie T you are a role model of generosity, unconditional love and goodness.RIP.  Auntie Therry even though you were the 5 in the line and last but 1 amongst your siblings your deliberately made sure you invested your resources in to every household of your siblings and your extended cousins from the oldest to the youngest of them all.You believed that you had more to give than any other person.Auntie I cannot remember any moment since from about 1972 when I can remember that I came to your home and there were less that 5 persons and even up to 10 or more leaving with you, and you provided for them with joy.From new born babies to men and women in their 30 s.We always looked forward to come to your home.Even when you had only 2 bedroom, there was always space for everyone.None of us could ever pass by your city without stopping by.How was it possible that you could feed all those mouth so joyfully ? Your home was a true miracle of the multiplication of 5 loaves and 2 fishes to feed thousands.You are forever in our.RIP.",
